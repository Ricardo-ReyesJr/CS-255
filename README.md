# CS-255 System Analysis & Design

The Documents in the *repo* are the business requirements and the system design documents. To summarize, DrivePass is a web app that helps student drivers do practice tests to improve their chances of passing their DMV test. DrivePass wanted and easily accessible system that can be accessed from any device, at any time, when the student or staff needed to access it. My understanding of networks and web development allowed me to understand the requirement and restrictions. I wouldn't change anything, I think that by running a web app allows the server to control everything without taxing the client side. I would say having servers in different time zones will help even better than having one centralized server. I can say the old clich√© for understanding the users of the system, that which is "I put myself in their shoes". I find it very important to understand the user. Keeping a customer happy will either bring more business from this customer or bring more new business. I like the design, and I jump on it as much as I jump into programming. I can sometimes spend too much time on design. I will try more of a visual design, bring some art talent for some help on the design work.
